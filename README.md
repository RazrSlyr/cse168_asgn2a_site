# CSE 168 Assignment 1B
## What is the Assignment?
The goal of the assignment was to create a simple MR experience with virtual objects in real scene
## How did we do it?
We accomplished this by using Meta's Quest tools for Unity. Specifically, the Scene SDK, which allows us to represent real world objects as game objects in Unity, was especially useful. You can read about it in more detail in our Writeup.
